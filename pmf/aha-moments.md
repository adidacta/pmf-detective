# MVP PRD — Aha Moment & Scope

<!-- AI_INSTRUCTION: Use this file to scope features, prioritize work,
     and structure onboarding. Everything in the MVP exists to deliver
     the aha moment. Anything not on the Path to Aha is out of scope. -->

## The Aha Moment

**"The Focus Shift"**

The senior dev starts a video in YouNote's clean workspace, writes their first note, and realizes: no recommendations, no comments, no distractions — just the video and their thoughts. "This is how I should've been learning."

**Why this moment:** It hits on first use. Unlike cross-video search or accumulated notes (which require multiple sessions), The Focus Shift lands immediately. The user doesn't need to build a habit first — they feel the difference in their first session.

## Path to Aha (MVP Scope)

Each step is a concrete, buildable requirement. Nothing extra.

1. **User opens YouNote** — Clean entry point, no onboarding friction
2. **Pastes or picks a YouTube video** — Simple input: URL or search
3. **Video loads in a distraction-free player** — No recommendations, no comments, no sidebar. Just the video.
4. **User starts watching and writes their first note** — Note panel alongside the video, ready to capture
5. **Note auto-timestamps to the video moment** — Each note links to the exact moment in the video
6. **AHA: "No distractions, my notes right here, timestamped — this is how I should've been learning."**

## In Scope for v1 (Beyond Path to Aha)

- **Folders & organization** — Simple folder structure so the senior dev feels "in control and on top of things" (ICP need). Even basic structure signals that their learning is accumulating, not scattering.

## Out of Scope (v2+)

- **Cross-video search** — Searching notes across all videos. Powerful but requires accumulated usage.
- **AI summaries** — Auto-generating summaries or flashcards from notes. Not on the aha path.
- **Social/sharing** — Sharing notes with teammates or exporting to other tools. Collaboration is a v2+ concern.

## Success Criteria

**Observable behavior:** They come back with a second video.

The aha moment isn't proven by a single use — it's proven when the user chooses YouNote over raw YouTube for their next learning session. Returning with a second video means The Focus Shift changed their default, not just caught their attention.

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should step 2 support both paste-a-URL and browse/search, or is paste-only sufficient for v1?
- [ ] Does the folder structure need to exist at first use, or can it be introduced after 3+ videos?
