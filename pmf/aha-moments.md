# Aha Moments & Key Benefits

## The Core Aha Moment
"I can click my note and it takes me right back" - the magic of timestamped links. One click returns them to the exact moment in the video.

## Must-Deliver Benefits
1. **Search across all notes** - Find any insight from any video instantly. Nothing is lost.
2. **Organize notes by topic/project** - Structure learning by what matters to them, not by video.
3. **Notes appear alongside the video** - No context switching. Capture thoughts without leaving YouTube.

## When Users "Get It"
After taking notes on their first video. The frictionless flow of capture → timestamp → organize clicks immediately. They realize this is how YouTube learning should feel.

## Proof Points
- Retention improvement (target: 2x better recall vs passive watching)
- Completion experience - the satisfaction of finishing a video with structured notes
