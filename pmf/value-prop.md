### Open Questions
- [ ] Is "experienced devs" too broad — should it specify "senior" or "mid-to-senior"?
- [ ] Does "how little sticks" land equally well in ad copy vs. landing page vs. in-product?

## Alternative Options (Reference Only)

### Pain-led
- **Message:** Tired of watching tutorials that don't stick? Turn passive watching into active learning.
- **Angle:** Pain-led — leads with frustration, resolves with Magnet
- **Why not selected:** Strong but generic opener ("Tired of...") — less distinctive than identity-led

### Aspiration-led
- **Message:** Turn passive watching into active learning — so every YouTube tutorial actually pays off.
- **Angle:** Aspiration-led — leads with the future, grounds in payoff
- **Why not selected:** Good for ads but doesn't create the "that's me" moment as strongly

### Action-led
- **Message:** Stop watching. Start learning. YouNote turns YouTube tutorials into active learning.
- **Angle:** Action-led — punchy imperative, Stop/Start contrast
- **Why not selected:** Punchy but slightly aggressive — "stop watching" could feel judgmental
