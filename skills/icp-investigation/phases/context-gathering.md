# Context Gathering (Pre-Phase 1)

## Goal
Welcome the user and gather initial context about their product/idea.

## Questions to Ask

Ask each question separately, waiting for a response:

1. "What are you building?"
2. "Who do you think it's for?"
3. "What change will it make in their lives?"

## Instructions

- Ask one question at a time
- Accept any level of detail - this is just context gathering
- Flag any uncertainty as {assumption_flag}
- After all 3 are answered, proceed to Phase 1
