# Phase 1: Starting Point Detection

## Goal
Understand where the user is starting from and whether they have a customer in mind.

## Main Question

Ask:
"Which best describes your starting point?"

1. I have an idea
2. I've observed a problem
3. I have a product or MVP

## Follow-up Based on Answer

**If idea:**
"What inspired this idea?"

**If problem:**
"Who experiences this problem, and how does it affect them?"

**If product:**
"How will your product change users' lives?"

## Branching Question

After the follow-up, ask:
"Do you already have a perfect customer in mind - someone you believe is ideal for what you're building?"

**If yes** → Proceed to Phase 2b (Bottom-Up approach)
**If no or unsure** → Proceed to Phase 2a (Top-Down approach)
