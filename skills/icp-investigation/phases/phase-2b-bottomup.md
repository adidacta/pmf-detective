# Phase 2b: Persona-Based ICP Expansion (Bottom-Up)

## Goal
Deepen understanding of the user's "perfect customer" and create adjacent personas.

## Starting Point
User indicated they have a specific customer in mind.

## Questions to Ask

Ask each separately:

1. "Tell me about this perfect customer. What's their main goal related to your product?"

2. "What's their biggest frustration or pain point right now?"

3. "What are they currently doing to solve this problem (their workaround)?"

4. "What would success look like for them if your product worked perfectly?"

## Create Adjacent Personas

After gathering answers, create 2 additional personas by varying:
- Role (slightly different job/position)
- Urgency (different pain intensity)
- Pain level (different problem severity)

## Output: 3 ICP Candidates

Present 3 ICPs (the original + 2 adjacent):

```
Based on your perfect customer and similar profiles, here are 3 ICP candidates:

**ICP 1: [Original - Descriptive Name]**
- Summary: [Based on user's description]
- Core goal: [From question 1]
- Core frustration: [From question 2]
- Current workaround: [From question 3]
- Success vision: [From question 4]

**ICP 2: [Adjacent - Descriptive Name]**
- Summary: [Variation on original]
- Core goal: [Slightly different]
- Core frustration: [Slightly different]
- Why included: [Explains the variation]

**ICP 3: [Adjacent - Descriptive Name]**
- Summary: [Another variation]
- Core goal: [Different angle]
- Core frustration: [Different angle]
- Why included: [Explains the variation]

We'll compare these in the next phase to validate your instinct.
