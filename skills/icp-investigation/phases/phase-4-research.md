# Phase 4: Deep Research

## Goal
Validate and deepen ICP understanding through web research.

## Research Focus

Use WebSearch to investigate:

1. **Pain validation** - Which ICP suffers the most and most often?
2. **Characteristics** - Additional traits, psychographics, or missing details
3. **Reachability** - Where each ICP gathers, how to reach them
4. **Gaps and risks** - Major assumptions that need validation

## Research Queries

Conduct multiple searches based on:

- "[ICP description] pain points"
- "[ICP description] challenges [industry/domain]"
- "Where do [ICP description] gather online"
- "[ICP description] buying behavior [product category]"
- "[Problem area] solutions [ICP type]"

## Process

1. Inform the user you're conducting research:

```
I'll now research your 3 ICP candidates to validate our comparison and fill in gaps.

Researching:
- Pain intensity and frequency for each ICP
- Where they gather and how to reach them
- Missing characteristics we should know about

This may take a moment...
```

2. Conduct 3-5 WebSearch queries
3. Synthesize findings

## Research Output

Present findings in this format:

```
**Research Findings**

**ICP 1: [Name]**
- Pain validation: [What research shows about their pain]
- Key insight: [Most important finding]
- Reachability: [Where they gather, how to reach]
- Risk/gap: [What we still don't know]

**ICP 2: [Name]**
[Same structure]

**ICP 3: [Name]**
[Same structure]

**Unclear Items to Validate**
- {assumption_flag}: [Item 1]
- {assumption_flag}: [Item 2]
- {assumption_flag}: [Item 3]

**Recommendation**
Based on urgency, reachability, and research alignment, [ICP X] appears strongest to start with.
```
