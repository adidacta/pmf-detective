# Phase 1: Final Review and Execution Readiness

## Goal
Ensure all materials are ready and confirm launch readiness.

## Process

Read and summarize these files:
- `pmf/icp-profile.md`
- `pmf/value-proposition.md`
- `pmf/mini-mvp-plan.md`
- `pmf/offer/strategy.md`

## Questions to Ask

Ask each separately:

1. "What's the ICP we will be testing? Feel free to confirm from your previous work or share updates."

2. "What value proposition are we focusing on? Feel free to share your narrative as well."

3. "What mini product have you prepared for the experiment?"

4. "Lastly, what is your irresistible offer for the ICP? What approach did you choose (cold outreach, organic content, or paid ads)?"
