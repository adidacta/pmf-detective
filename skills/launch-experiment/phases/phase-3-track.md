- CPC (cost per click)
- Conversion rate
- CPA (cost per acquisition)
- ROAS (if applicable)

## Check-in Questions

If user is tracking with you:

```
**Progress Check-in**

Let's see how you're doing:

1. What day of the plan are you on?
2. What actions have you completed?
3. What results have you seen so far?
4. Any blockers or challenges?
```

## Feedback Collection

Encourage feedback gathering:

```
**Collecting Feedback**

As you get responses, look for:

1. **What resonates** - What do people respond positively to?
2. **What confuses** - What questions do they ask?
3. **What objections** - Why do they say no?
4. **Language** - What words do they use to describe their problem?

Would you like me to provide a feedback survey template or follow-up message template?
```

## Survey Template (if requested)

```
**Quick Feedback Survey**

1. What's your biggest challenge with [problem area]? (Open-ended)
2. How are you currently solving this? (Open-ended)
3. What would make a solution "must-have" for you? (Open-ended)
4. Would you pay for a solution? (Yes/No/Maybe)
5. What would you expect to pay? (Range options)
```

## Optimization Guidance

Based on results:

**If low response rate:**
- Review subject lines/hooks
- Check personalization
- Adjust targeting
- Test different times

**If responses but no conversions:**
- Review offer clarity
- Check mini-product value
- Address objections
- Simplify CTA

**If good engagement but wrong audience:**
- Refine ICP targeting
- Adjust messaging angle
- Consider different channels

## Iteration Reminder

```
Remember: Experiments rarely go viral right away.

Keep testing and refining. Each iteration teaches you something.

What adjustments would you like to try?
