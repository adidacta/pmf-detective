# Phase 1: ICP and Value Proposition Confirmation

## Goal
Ensure the user has clear ICP and value proposition to work from.

## Process

Check for and read:
- `pmf/icp-profile.md`
- `pmf/value-proposition.md`
- `pmf/brand-narrative.md` (optional)

## If Files Exist

Ask each separately:

1. "What is the ICP you want to target with this mini-product? Feel free to paste your ICP brief or confirm you want to use the one from your previous sprint."

2. "Can you confirm your primary value proposition based on this ICP?"

3. (Optional) "If you have a brand narrative for your ICP, please share it as well."

## If Files Don't Exist

"To plan your mini-product effectively, I need your ICP and value proposition.

Do you have these ready to share, or would you like to complete those sprints first? Use /start-sprint icp to begin."

## What to Extract

Note these for later phases:
- ICP summary (who they are)
- Primary value proposition
- Key problem being solved
- Desired outcome

## Progress Display
