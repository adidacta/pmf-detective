# Phase 1: Collecting ICP, Value Prop, Narrative, and Mini Product

## Goal
Gather the essential details that will define the offer.

## Process

Check for and read these files:
- `pmf/icp-profile.md`
- `pmf/value-proposition.md`
- `pmf/brand-narrative.md`
- `pmf/mini-product-plan.md`

## If Files Exist

Summarize what you found and ask for confirmation:

```
I found your validation documents:

**ICP:** [Brief summary]
**Value Proposition:** [The selected VP]
**Brand Narrative:** [Key points]
**Mini-Product:** [What they're building]

Are these correct and up-to-date? Reply "yes" to continue or share any updates.
```

## If Files Don't Exist

Ask for each asset separately:

1. "Please share your ICP brief (you should have it from the ICP Workshop sprint)."
2. "What is your value proposition?"
3. "Do you have a brand narrative? If so, please share it."
4. "What mini-product have you prepared for the experiment?"

## What to Extract

Note these for offer creation:
- ICP pain points and language
- Value proposition (the hook)
- Brand story (emotional connection)
- Mini-product (what they're offering)
