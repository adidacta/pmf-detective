# Phase 2: Choosing the Outreach Approach

## Goal
Help the user select the best promotion strategy based on their situation.

## The 3 Approaches

Present clearly:

```
Now let's choose your outreach approach. Here are your options:

**1. Organic Content**
Best when: You're already familiar with your ICP and have a network
Pros: Free, builds authority, compounds over time
Cons: Takes time to gain traction
Works for: LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads, YouTube videos, blog content

**2. Cold Outreach**
Best when: Building relationships with new people or your ICP isn't in your network
Pros: Direct, personal, fast feedback
Cons: Requires research and personalization
Works for: LinkedIn DMs, cold emails, Reddit engagement

**3. Paid Ads**
Best when: You need to reach a broader audience quickly and have budget
Pros: Fast results, scalable, precise targeting
Cons: Requires budget, learning curve
Works for: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google ads

Which of these approaches feels like the best fit for you right now?
```

## If User Is Indecisive

Help them decide with questions:

```
Let me help you decide:

1. Do you have an existing audience or network in your ICP's space?
   - Yes → Organic might be best
   - No → Cold outreach or Paid

2. Do you have budget for ads ($100-500 to start)?
   - Yes → Paid is an option
   - No → Organic or Cold

3. Are you comfortable reaching out to strangers?
   - Yes → Cold outreach works
   - No → Organic or Paid

Based on this, I'd recommend [approach] because [reason].

Remember: if this doesn't work, you can always come back and try another approach. This is just the first step.
```

## Important

- Do NOT proceed until user has selected an approach
- User should be fairly confident about their choice
- Remind them they can try other approaches later
