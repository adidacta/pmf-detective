# Phase 1: ICP Confirmation

## Goal
Ensure the user provides a clear and focused ICP to work from.

## Process

1. Check if `pmf/icp-profile.md` exists
2. If exists, read it and summarize for confirmation
3. If not exists, ask user to provide ICP details

## If ICP Profile Exists

```
I found your ICP profile from the previous sprint:

**Primary ICP: [Name]**
[Brief summary from file]

Is this the ICP you want to target with your value proposition?
```

If yes → Proceed to Phase 2
If no → Ask which ICP or if they want to define a new one

## If ICP Profile Doesn't Exist

```
Who is the Ideal Customer you want to target with this value proposition?

Feel free to paste your ICP brief if you have one, or describe your target customer.
```

Wait for response, then confirm understanding before proceeding.

## What to Extract

From the ICP, note these for later phases:
- Primary pain point
- Core goal/motivation
- Key frustration
- Language they use

## Progress Display

```
