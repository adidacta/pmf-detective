# Phase 3: Generate Value Proposition Assumptions

## Goal
Create 4 distinct value propositions using different persuasive formulas.

## The 4 VP Formulas (Internal - Don't Share)

1. **Goal Achievement:** Help {ICP} achieve {Motivation}
2. **Pain + Goal:** Help {ICP}, who experiences {Pain}, to achieve {Motivation}
3. **Superlative:** The most {Quality} {Product} for {ICP}
4. **Stop/Start:** Stop {Bad Action} and start {Good Outcome}

## Process

Using the ICP and StoryBrand narrative, generate 4 variations highlighting different angles:

- **VP 1:** Goal achieved focus
- **VP 2:** Pain relief focus
- **VP 3:** Identity/superlative focus
- **VP 4:** Urgency/behavior change focus

## Output Format

```
Based on your ICP and brand narrative, here are 4 value proposition variations:

**Value Proposition 1** (Goal Focus)
"[Generated VP using formula 1]"

**Value Proposition 2** (Pain Focus)
"[Generated VP using formula 2]"

**Value Proposition 3** (Identity Focus)
"[Generated VP using formula 3]"

**Value Proposition 4** (Action Focus)
"[Generated VP using formula 4]"

Which of these resonate most with you so far? We'll refine them after validating through research.
```

## User Feedback

Ask which VPs feel strongest:
- "All of them" → Great, we'll validate all 4
- Specific preferences → Note for Phase 5
- Concerns → Address and adjust

## Important

- Do NOT proceed to Phase 4 without user agreement on the 4 VPs
- Make adjustments if user requests
- Clarify that these are assumptions to be validated

## Progress Display
