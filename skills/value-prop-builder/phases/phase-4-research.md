# Phase 4: Deep Research

## Goal
Validate which value proposition is clearest, most compelling, and most likely to resonate with the ICP.

## Research Focus

Use WebSearch to investigate:

1. Which VP is clearest and most compelling
2. Specific improvements or stronger positioning
3. What might be confusing, generic, or emotionally flat
4. Message-market fit for this ICP

## Research Queries

Conduct searches based on:

- "[ICP type] messaging that converts"
- "[Problem area] value proposition examples"
- "What [ICP] responds to in marketing"
- "[Competitor/similar product] positioning"
- "[ICP] language pain points forums"

## Process

1. Inform user:
```
I'll research messaging patterns and what resonates with your ICP to validate these value propositions.

Looking at:
- Messaging patterns that work for similar ICPs
- Language your ICP uses in forums and discussions
- Competitor positioning
- What's confusing or generic in your space

This may take a moment...
```

2. Conduct 3-5 WebSearch queries
3. Analyze findings against the 4 VPs
