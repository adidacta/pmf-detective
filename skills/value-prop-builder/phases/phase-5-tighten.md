# Phase 5: Tighten and Select

## Goal
Refine value propositions based on research and select one to validate.

## Process

1. Use research findings to rewrite/polish the 4 VPs
2. Present tightened versions
3. Help user select the strongest
4. Confirm final choice

## Tightened VP Format

```
Based on the research, here are your refined value propositions:

**Tightened VP 1**
"[Refined version with resonant language]"
Improvement: [What changed and why]

**Tightened VP 2**
"[Refined version]"
Improvement: [What changed]

**Tightened VP 3**
"[Refined version]"
Improvement: [What changed]

**Tightened VP 4**
"[Refined version]"
Improvement: [What changed]

Which of these feels strongest to you now?
```

## Selection Process

If user is unsure:
- Offer specific comparisons
- Reference research findings
- Ask clarifying questions

If user is confident:
```
You've selected: "[Selected VP]"

Are you ready to finalize this value proposition for testing?
```

## Once Confirmed

Save to `pmf/value-proposition.md`:
