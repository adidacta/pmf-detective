<!-- AI_INSTRUCTION: This file defines the minimum viable product scope.
     The Core Aha Moment is the destination — the experience the MVP must deliver.
     The Path to Aha is reverse-engineered from that moment: each step is
     a requirement the product must fulfill to get the user there.
     Out of Scope prevents scope creep. Use this file when building features,
     prioritizing work, or evaluating what to cut. If it's not on the path,
     it's not in v1. -->

## The Core Aha Moment
> [The single moment when users think "THIS is why I need this"]

**Why this is the highest-value moment:** [Brief explanation of why this aha moment matters most to the ICP]

## Path to Aha

<!-- AI_INSTRUCTION: This is the MVP scope. Each step was reverse-engineered
     from the aha moment. The product must deliver every step on this path.
     Steps are ordered from the user's starting point to the aha moment. -->

### 1. [First step — where the user starts]
> [What the product needs to deliver at this step]

### 2. [Next step]
> [What the product needs to deliver at this step]

### 3. [Next step]
> [What the product needs to deliver at this step]

### N. [The aha moment]
> [The experience that makes it all click]

## Out of Scope (v1)
- [Capability explicitly NOT in v1]
- [Capability explicitly NOT in v1]
- [Capability explicitly NOT in v1]

## Success Criteria
**The aha moment has landed when:** [Observable user behavior that proves they "got it"]
