# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Directory Is

This is a **test/output directory** for the PMF Detective skill plugin. It contains:
- Generated PMF validation documents in `pmf/`
- A landing page prototype in `landing-page/`

This is NOT the PMF Detective source code - it's where the skill outputs its artifacts when helping a founder validate a startup idea.

## Directory Structure

```
pmf/                    # PMF validation outputs (markdown docs)
├── icp-profile.md      # Ideal Customer Profile
├── brand-narrative.md  # StoryBrand 7-part narrative
├── value-proposition.md # Selected value proposition
├── mini-product-plan.md # Mini-product tasks/timeline
├── skills-assessment.md # Founder skills evaluation
└── offer/              # Go-to-market strategy
    ├── strategy.md
    └── organic-content.md

landing-page/           # Prototype landing page
└── index.html          # Static HTML + Tailwind CSS
```

## Working With This Directory

### Landing Page Development

Preview the landing page:
```bash
open landing-page/index.html
```

The landing page uses:
- Plain HTML (no build step)
- Tailwind CSS via CDN
- Inter font from Google Fonts

### PMF Documents

All `pmf/*.md` files are generated by PMF Detective sprints. They follow specific templates and should be edited through the skill workflow, not manually.

## PMF Detective Skills

This directory is created/managed by these skills (invoke via `/start-sprint`):
1. `icp-workshop` - Creates icp-profile.md
2. `value-prop-builder` - Creates brand-narrative.md, value-proposition.md
3. `mini-product-planner` - Creates mini-product-plan.md, skills-assessment.md
4. `offer-architect` - Creates offer/strategy.md, offer/organic-content.md
5. `launch-experiment` - Creates experiment/results.md
