## The 7-Part StoryBrand Framework

1. **Character:** A constant learner with preference for video tutorials on YouTube
2. **Problem:** Searching YouTube history to find information they need but can't remember where they saw it
3. **Guide:** YouNote puts everything in order - searchable, timestamped notes that are always yours
4. **Plan:** Add notes while you watch - YouNote handles the rest (timestamps, MD format, search)
5. **Call to Action:** Start your first note (paste a YouTube link)
6. **Avoid Failure:** Slow learning, missed insights, forgetting what you already learned and invested in
7. **Success:** Feel relaxed and in control with your own personal library of knowledge

## Full Narrative

Learning from videos is amazing, but YouTube is filled with distractions and noise. And once you're done with a video, it's usually gone - and so are the lessons you learned there. When you want it back, you waste time digging through YouTube history, rewatching videos, or worse - relearning things you've already invested in.

That's where YouNote comes in. It puts everything in order, making it easy to create searchable, timestamped notes that are always yours. Just add notes while you watch - YouNote handles the rest: saving timestamps, keeping everything in portable MD format, and letting you search whenever you need.

Start your first note by pasting a YouTube link. Instead of slow learning, missed insights, and forgetting what you've already mastered, you'll feel relaxed and in control - with your own personal library of knowledge at your fingertips.
