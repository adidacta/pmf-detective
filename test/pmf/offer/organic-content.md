### Hook Post (Twitter/Reddit)

```
I've watched 500+ hours of coding tutorials on YouTube.

I remember maybe 10% of it.

The problem isn't my memory. It's that:
• YouTube has no built-in notes
• My notes aren't linked to timestamps
• I can't search what I've learned

So I'm building something to fix this.

### Story Post (Twitter/Dev.to)

```
Last week I spent 20 minutes hunting for "that one part"
in a 2-hour React tutorial.

I knew I'd watched it. I knew it explained exactly
what I needed. But I couldn't find it.

That's when I realized:
Watching tutorials ≠ Learning

What if every note you took was automatically
timestamped and searchable?

That's what I'm building: YouNote

Stop watching. Start retaining.

### Value Post (Reddit r/learnprogramming)

```
3 ways to actually retain what you learn from YouTube tutorials:

1. Take notes WITH timestamps (not after)
2. Export notes to a searchable format (markdown)
3. Review notes before rewatching

I couldn't find a tool that did all 3, so I'm building one.

Would love feedback from fellow learners: [link]

### Myth-Buster Post (Twitter)

```
"Just rewatch the video if you forget"

This is terrible advice.

A 2-hour tutorial takes 2 hours to rewatch.
Finding one specific concept? Good luck.

Better approach:
→ Timestamped notes while watching
→ Search your notes, not YouTube

I'm building this. Join the waitlist: [link]

### Building in Public Post (Twitter)

```
Day 1 of building YouNote:

The problem: Developers watch hours of YouTube tutorials
but can't find specific lessons later.

The solution: Timestamped notes in markdown you own.

YouTube learning frustration.
