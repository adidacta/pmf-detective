## Summary

Strong all-rounder with high capability across all key areas. Can execute any mini-product type, so the constraint is time-to-validation, not skills.

## Recommended Approach

Given high skills across the board:
- **Avoid over-building** - the temptation to build the "real thing" is high
- **Prioritize speed** - use skills to move fast, not to add complexity
- **Validate first** - landing page before product, waitlist before features
