# Value Proposition
*Generated: 2026-01-08 | Sprint: Value Prop Builder*

## Selected Value Proposition

> "Never lose a lesson again. Turn YouTube tutorials into timestamped notes you own."

**Tagline:**
> "Stop watching. Start retaining."

**Selected because:**
- "Never lose" echoes proven messaging patterns (Evernote's "Remember everything")
- "Timestamped notes you own" differentiates from cloud-locked competitors
- "Retaining" focuses on the learning outcome, not just the feature
- Specific and clear - passes the clarity test
- Emphasizes ownership (portable MD format) - unique vs NoteGPT, LunaNotes, etc.

## Alternative Value Propositions

### VP 1: Knowledge Library Focus
> "Your YouTube learnings, organized and searchable - yours forever in markdown"

### VP 2: Speed Focus
> "Find any moment from any tutorial you've watched - in seconds"

### VP 3: Action Focus (Tagline)
> "Stop rewatching. Start finding."

## Assumptions to Validate
- [ ] Whether "own" / "yours" resonates more than "searchable"
- [ ] How price-sensitive ICP is vs free competitors (Transnote is "free forever")
- [ ] Whether "retaining" outcome messaging converts better than "finding" feature messaging
- [ ] If "timestamped notes" is clear enough or needs more explanation

## Competitive Positioning

YouNote differentiates from competitors by emphasizing:
1. **Ownership** - Notes are yours in portable MD format, not locked in a platform
2. **Simplicity** - Not AI-heavy like NoteGPT/LunaNotes; you write notes, it handles timestamps
3. **Focus** - Distraction-free learning environment away from YouTube.com
